# Hello, Markdown!

It's *sooo* nice to be able to write in this simple format.

One you have a hang of *it*, you just:

* Remember the basic syntax
* Write your doc
* Done!

Now you can be a Wiz at this language and code up stuff like `console.writeLine("Hello, Markdown!");`

Can't remember the language? No problem! Just visit one of theese resources:
